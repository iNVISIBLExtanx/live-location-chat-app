# Real-Time Chat with Live Location Sharing App

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile application similar to Uber's driver-passenger interaction flow, where users can see each other's live location on a map and communicate through a real-time chat. The app will be built using Expo and React Native with TypeScript for the frontend, and Supabase for backend services.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication
- User registration and login
- User profiles
- Role-based access (drivers vs passengers)

### 2. Real-Time Location Sharing
- Continuous location tracking
- Real-time location updates on the map
- Estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculation
- Route visualization

### 3. Real-Time Chat
- One-to-one messaging
- Push notifications for new messages
- Message history
- Support for text messages (potential future enhancement: media sharing)

### 4. Map Interface
- Interactive map display
- User location markers
- Trip status visualization
- Address search and geocoding

### 5. Trip Management
- Trip request
- Trip acceptance/rejection
- Trip status updates
- Trip history

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Expo**: Development framework to build and deploy React Native apps
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile app development
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Navigation**: Navigation between screens
- **MapView**: Map display using Expo's MapView or react-native-maps
- **Expo Location**: Access to device location services
- **Expo Notifications**: Push notifications handling

### Backend (Supabase)
- **Authentication**: User management and authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for storing user data, trip information, etc.
- **Real-Time**: Supabase Realtime for live updates (location sharing and chat)
- **Storage**: File storage for user profiles and potential message attachments
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom backend logic

## Architecture Overview

### Data Model
1. **Users**
   - ID, name, email, phone, role (driver/passenger), profile image

2. **Trips**
   - ID, passenger_id, driver_id, pickup_location, destination, status, created_at, updated_at

3. **Locations**
   - ID, user_id, latitude, longitude, timestamp, trip_id (optional)

4. **Messages**
   - ID, sender_id, receiver_id, trip_id, content, timestamp, read_status

### Real-Time Architecture
- **Location Updates**: Use Supabase Realtime to subscribe to location changes
- **Chat Messages**: Use Supabase Realtime for instant message delivery
- **Trip Status**: Subscribe to trip status changes for real-time updates

## Technical Considerations

### Location Tracking
- Implement background location tracking with appropriate battery optimization
- Consider privacy implications and permission handling
- Implement geo-fencing for arrival notifications

### Real-Time Performance
- Optimize update frequency for location sharing (balance between responsiveness and battery life)
- Implement efficient data structures for real-time updates
- Consider offline support and synchronization

### Security
- Secure user authentication
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Rate limiting for API requests
- Input validation and sanitization

### Scalability
- Design database schema for efficient querying
- Implement pagination for chat history and trip history
- Consider potential future scaling needs

## Development Approach
- Use Expo managed workflow for rapid development
- Follow a component-based architecture
- Implement state management using React Context API or Redux
- Apply TypeScript strictly to ensure type safety
- Create reusable UI components
- Use Supabase client SDK for database and real-time operations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit testing with Jest
- Component testing with React Native Testing Library
- E2E testing with Detox
- Manual testing on both iOS and Android devices
- Performance testing for real-time features

## Deployment Strategy
- Use Expo EAS Build for building native binaries
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Plan for phased rollout with beta testing

## Future Enhancements
- Voice/video calling
- Multi-language support
- Advanced trip analytics
- Integration with payment gateways
- Rating and review system
